# 🌲 ACM Workshop: Git & Version Control

Welcome! In this guide, we will set up **Git**, the industry-standard tool for tracking code changes and collaborating with other developers.

**What you’ll learn:**
* **The Concept:** Understanding Version Control Systems (VCS) as "save points."
* **The Setup:** How to install and configure Git on Windows and macOS.
* **The Commands:** The essential cheat sheet for your daily workflow.

***

## 🧠 1. What is Version Control?
Think of **Git** as a time machine for your code. It allows you to:
1.  **Track History:** See exactly who changed what line of code and when.
2.  **Collaborate:** Merge work from multiple people into one project without overwriting files.
3.  **Revert:** Broke the app? Jump back to a previous "save point" (commit) instantly.

### The Workflow
Visualizing where your code lives is half the battle.

| **Working Directory** | The files you are currently editing in VS Code.                   |
| **Staging Area**      | The "on-deck" circle. Files you are *about* to save.              |
| **Local Repository**  | Your private history of saved snapshots (commits) on your laptop. |
| **Remote Repository** | The cloud version (GitHub/GitLab) where the team shares code.     |
