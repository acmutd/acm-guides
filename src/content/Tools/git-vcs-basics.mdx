# 🌲 ACM Workshop: Git & Version Control

Welcome! In this guide, we will set up **Git**, the industry-standard tool for tracking code changes and collaborating with other developers.

**What you’ll learn:**
* **The Concept:** Understanding Version Control Systems (VCS) as "save points."
* **The Setup:** How to install and configure Git on Windows and macOS.
* **The Commands:** The essential cheat sheet for your daily workflow.

***

## 🧠 1. What is Version Control?
Think of **Git** as a time machine for your code. It allows you to:
1.  **Track History:** See exactly who changed what line of code and when.
2.  **Collaborate:** Merge work from multiple people into one project without overwriting files.
3.  **Revert:** Broke the app? Jump back to a previous "save point" (commit) instantly.

### The Workflow
Visualizing where your code lives is half the battle.

| Stage                 | Description                                                       |
|:----------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Working Directory** | The files you are currently editing in VS Code.                   |
| **Staging Area**      | The "on-deck" circle. Files you are *about* to save.              |
| **Local Repository**  | Your private history of saved snapshots (commits) on your laptop. |
| **Remote Repository** | The cloud version (GitHub/GitLab) where the team shares code.     |

## 💿 2. Installation
Before we start, verify if you already have Git installed.

**Verification Command:**
```bash
git --version
```

*If you see a version number (e.g., `git version 2.40.0`), you are good to go! If not, follow the steps below.*

### 🪟 Windows

1. **Download:** Go to [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
2. **Run Installer:** Download the "Standalone Installer" (64-bit).
3. **The Setup Wizard:**
* Keep hitting "Next" through the defaults.
* *Critical:* When asked about the default editor, select **Visual Studio Code**.
* *Critical:* Ensure "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" is selected.



### 🍎 macOS

You have two easy options.

**Option A: Xcode Command Line Tools (Easiest)**
Open your terminal and type:

```bash
git --version
```

If not installed, macOS will prompt you to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Click "Install."

**Option B: Homebrew (Preferred)**
If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed:

```bash
brew install git
```

## ⚙️ 3. First-Time Configuration

Once installed, you must introduce yourself to Git. This information will appear next to every change you make.

Open your terminal and run these two commands:

```bash
# 1. Set your username (Use your GitHub username or real name)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# 2. Set your email (Must match your GitHub email!)
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

**Verify your config:**

```bash
git config --list
```

## ⚡ 4. Essential Commands

These are the commands you will use 99% of the time.

### Starting Out

| Action    | Command           | Description                                           |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Clone** | `git clone <URL>` | Download an existing repo from GitHub to your laptop. |
| **Init**  | `git init`        | Turn your current folder into a brand new Git repo.   |

### The "Save" Cycle

Every time you finish a task, follow this 3-step rhythm:

**1. Add (Stage)**
Move changes to the staging area.

```bash
git add .
```

*(The `.` means "add all changed files". You can also specify a filename).*

**2. Commit (Save)**
Take a snapshot of the staged files.

```bash
git commit -m "Fixed the login bug"
```

*(Always write a clear message describing what you changed).*

**3. Push (Upload)**
Send your commits to the cloud (GitHub).

```bash
git push
```

### Checking In

**Status (The MVP)**
Run this constantly. It tells you what files are changed, staged, or untracked.

```bash
git status
```

**Log**
See the history of commits (the timeline).

```bash
git log --oneline
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "fatal: not a git repository"

You are trying to run a git command inside a folder that isn't tracked.

* **Fix:** `cd` into the correct folder where you ran `git init` or `git clone`.

### "Permission denied (publickey)"

GitHub doesn't recognize your computer.

* **Fix:** You likely need to set up an SSH key or use a Personal Access Token. For beginners, try cloning using the **HTTPS** URL instead of the **SSH** URL.

### "Merge conflict"

Two people changed the same line of code. Git doesn't know whose version to keep.

* **Fix:** Open the file in VS Code. You will see highlighted sections showing "Current Change" vs "Incoming Change". Choose one, save the file, then `git add .` and `git commit` again.
