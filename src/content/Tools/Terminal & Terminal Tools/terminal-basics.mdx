Welcome! In this guide, we will get comfortable with the **terminal** - the text-based interface that lets you control your computer like a developer. Most guides on this site assume you can use it, so let's make sure you can.

**What you'll learn:**

- **The Concept:** What the terminal actually is and why we use it.
- **The Setup:** How to open a good terminal on Windows and macOS.
- **The Commands:** The essential cheat sheet for navigating and managing files.

## 🧠 1. What is the Terminal?

Your computer has two interfaces: the one with windows and icons you click, and the terminal - a text box where you type commands directly. Developers use it because it's faster, more powerful, and because most dev tools (like Git and Node) are designed for it first.

The terms **terminal**, **shell**, and **command line** are often used interchangeably. Technically they're different things, but for our purposes they all mean the same thing: the place where you type commands.

## 💿 2. Opening a Terminal

### 🍎 macOS / 🐧 Linux

Your machine comes with a perfectly good terminal out of the box.

**Built-in (works great):**
Open **Spotlight** (`Cmd + Space`), type "Terminal", and hit Enter.

**Recommended upgrade:**
[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is a free replacement with better tab support, split panes, and search. Install it via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install --cask iterm2
```

Either way, the commands are identical. It's just a window preference.

### 🪟 Windows

Windows has two older terminals (`cmd.exe` and PowerShell) but neither uses the same commands as macOS/Linux. The fix is **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**, which gives you a real Linux terminal on Windows. This is what the rest of this guide assumes.

**Install WSL:**
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
wsl --install
```

Restart your machine when prompted. After rebooting, search for **Ubuntu** in the Start Menu. That's your new terminal.

> **Why WSL?** Every dev tool, tutorial, and guide (including ours) is written with Mac/Linux commands in mind. WSL means you can follow along without translating every command.

## ⚙️ 3. First-Time Setup

Before diving in, it's worth making sure your terminal is integrated with VS Code so you can open it right inside your editor without switching windows.

**In VS Code**, open the integrated terminal with:

| macOS / Linux  | Windows (WSL)  |
|:---------------|:---------------|
| `` Ctrl + ` `` | `` Ctrl + ` `` |

On Windows, VS Code should automatically detect WSL. If it doesn't, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`) and search for **"Select Default Profile"** → pick **WSL Bash**.

## ⚡ 4. Essential Commands

These are the commands you will use constantly. The syntax is the same on macOS, Linux, and WSL.

### Navigating Around

Think of the terminal as a file explorer where you type instead of click. At any moment, you are "inside" a folder. This is called your <Tooltip tip="The folder you are currently inside in the terminal. Commands run relative to this location.">working directory</Tooltip>.

**Where am I?**
```bash
pwd
```
_Prints the full path of your current folder, e.g. `/Users/yourname/projects`._

**What's in here?**
```bash
ls
```
_Lists all files and folders in the current directory._
```bash
ls -la
```
_Same, but also shows hidden files (ones starting with `.`) and file permissions._

**Move into a folder:**
```bash
cd projects
```

**Move up one level:**
```bash
cd ..
```

**Go straight home:**
```bash
cd ~
```
_`~` is a shortcut for your home directory (`/Users/yourname` on Mac, `/home/yourname` on Linux/WSL)._

**Jump anywhere with a full path:**
```bash
cd ~/projects/my-app
```

---

### Managing Files & Folders

**Create a new folder:**
```bash
mkdir my-project
```

**Create a new file:**
```bash
touch index.html
```

**Copy a file:**
```bash
cp index.html index-backup.html
```

**Move or rename a file:**
```bash
mv index.html src/index.html   # move
mv old-name.html new-name.html # rename
```

**Delete a file:**
```bash
rm index.html
```

**Delete a folder and everything inside it:**
```bash
rm -rf my-project
```

> ⚠️ `rm -rf` is permanent. There's no Recycle Bin. Double-check your path before running it.

---

### Reading Files

**Print a file's contents:**
```bash
cat package.json
```

**Open a file in VS Code from the terminal:**
```bash
code index.html
```

**Open your entire current folder in VS Code:**
```bash
code .
```

### Handy Shortcuts

These work everywhere and will save you a lot of time:

| Shortcut   | What it does                                                                                                                          |
|:-----------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Tab`      | <Tooltip tip="Completes a filename or command so you don't have to type the whole thing">Autocomplete</Tooltip> a file or folder name |
| `↑ / ↓`    | Scroll through your previous commands                                                                                                 |
| `Ctrl + C` | Cancel a running command                                                                                                              |
| `Ctrl + L` | Clear the screen                                                                                                                      |
| `Ctrl + A` | Jump to the start of the line                                                                                                         |
| `Ctrl + E` | Jump to the end of the line                                                                                                           |

## 🪟 Windows-Specific Notes

If you're ever stuck in plain PowerShell or `cmd.exe` instead of WSL, here's the translation for the most common commands:

| What you want | macOS / Linux / WSL | PowerShell         |
|:--------------|:--------------------|:-------------------|
| Where am I?   | `pwd`               | `pwd`              |
| List files    | `ls`                | `dir`              |
| Change folder | `cd projects`       | `cd projects`      |
| Create folder | `mkdir my-project`  | `mkdir my-project` |
| Create file   | `touch index.html`  | `ni index.html`    |
| Delete file   | `rm file.html`      | `rm file.html`     |
| Delete folder | `rm -rf folder`     | `rm -r folder`     |

That being said... just use WSL. Despite the similarities in some commands above, UNIX is superior in almost every way.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "command not found"

The terminal doesn't recognize what you typed.

- **Fix:** Check for typos. If the command is something you just installed (like `git` or `node`), try closing and reopening your terminal, as it needs to reload to pick up new programs.

### "permission denied"

You don't have the rights to run that command or access that file.

- **Fix:** On macOS/Linux, prefix the command with `sudo` to run it as an administrator: `sudo rm locked-file.txt`. It will ask for your password.

### My terminal opened in the wrong folder

- **Fix:** Use `cd` to navigate where you need to go, or open VS Code in the right folder first and use the integrated terminal. It will open directly in your project root.

### WSL can't find my Windows files

Your Windows files live at `/mnt/c/` in WSL. So `C:\Users\yourname\projects` becomes:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/yourname/projects
```
