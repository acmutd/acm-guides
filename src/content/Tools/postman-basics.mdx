Welcome! In this guide, we will set up **Postman**, the industry-standard tool for testing, documenting, and building APIs.

**What you’ll learn:**

- **The Concept:** Understanding APIs using the "Restaurant" metaphor.
- **The Setup:** How to install and configure Postman on Windows and macOS.
- **The Commands:** The essential cheat sheet for making requests.

## 🧠 1. What is an API?

Think of an **API** (Application Programming Interface) as a **waiter in a restaurant**.

1.  **You (The Client):** You look at the menu (documentation) and give an order (request) to the waiter.
2.  **The Waiter (The API):** Takes your order to the kitchen and ensures it's formatted correctly.
3.  **The Kitchen (The Server):** Prepares your food (data).
4.  **The Waiter:** Brings the food back to you (response).

### The Anatomy of a Request

Just like a sentence needs a verb and a noun, an API request needs specific parts to work.

| Part              | Description                                                   |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Method (Verb)** | What you want to do (e.g., `GET` implies retrieving data).    |
| **URL (Address)** | Where the kitchen lives (e.g., `api.github.com/users`).       |
| **Headers**       | Meta-information, like authentication tokens or content type. |
| **Body**          | The data you are sending _to_ the server (used in POST/PUT).  |
| **Status Code**   | The result. `200` is OK, `404` is Missing, `500` is Broken.   |

## 💿 2. Installation

Before we start, let's get the tool on your machine. While Postman has a web version, we recommend the Desktop App for local development.

**Verification:**
After installing, simply open the app. If you see a "Workspaces" dashboard, you are good to go!

### 🪟 Windows

1.  **Download:** Go to [postman.com/downloads](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
2.  **Run Installer:** Download the Windows 64-bit installer.
3.  **The Setup:**
    - Run the `.exe` file.
    - Postman installs silently and will open automatically when finished.
    - _Note:_ You may be asked to sign in. You can "Skip" to the app, but creating a free account is recommended to save your work to the cloud.

### 🍎 macOS

You have two easy options.

**Option A: Manual Download (Standard)**

1.  Go to [postman.com/downloads](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
2.  Click "Download" (Select "Apple Chip" if you have M1/M2/M3, or "Intel" for older Macs).
3.  Unzip the file and drag the **Postman** app into your `Applications` folder.

**Option B: Homebrew (Preferred)**
If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed:

```bash
brew install --cask postman
```

## ⚙️ 3. First-Time Configuration

Once installed, organizing your work is key. Postman uses **Collections** to group related requests (like folders).

**1. Create a Workspace:**

- Click **Workspaces** in the top-left → **Create Workspace**.
- Name it "ACM Workshop" and select "Personal".

**2. Create a Collection:**

- In the left sidebar, click the **+** button next to **Collections**.
- Name it "My First API".

**3. Set an Environment (Optional but Pro):**

- Click **Environments** in the sidebar.
- Add a variable named `baseURL` with a value of `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`.
- _Why?_ Now you can use `{{baseURL}}/users` instead of typing the full URL every time.

## ⚡ 4. Essential Commands

These are the HTTP methods you will use 99% of the time.

### The "CRUD" Actions

| Action     | Method      | Description                                           |
| :--------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create** | `POST`      | Send new data to the server (e.g., Sign up a user).   |
| **Read**   | `GET`       | Retrieve data from the server (e.g., Load a profile). |
| **Update** | `PUT/PATCH` | Edit existing data (e.g., Change a password).         |
| **Delete** | `DELETE`    | Remove data from the server (e.g., Delete a post).    |

### The Request Cycle

Every time you want to test an endpoint, follow this 3-step rhythm:

**1. Configure**
Select your method and paste the URL.

```text
[GET] https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1
```

**2. Send**
Hit the big blue **Send** button.

- _Watch the bottom pane:_ This is where the JSON response appears.
- _Check the status:_ Look for **200 OK** in green.

**3. Save**
Don't lose your work!

- Click **Save** (Cmd/Ctrl + S).
- Give it a name (e.g., "Get Todo Item") and save it to your "My First API" collection.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "404 Not Found"

The waiter couldn't find what you asked for.

- **Fix:** Check your URL for typos. Did you mean `/users` instead of `/user`?

### "401 Unauthorized" or "403 Forbidden"

The bouncer stopped you at the door.

- **Fix:** You need an API Key or Token. Go to the **Auth** tab in your request, select "Bearer Token" (or "API Key"), and paste your credential.

### "Could not get any response"

Postman can't reach the server at all.

- **Fix:** If you are testing a local server (e.g., `localhost:3000`), ensure your server is actually running in your terminal. If using the _Web Version_ of Postman, you might need to install the **Postman Desktop Agent**.

### "400 Bad Request"

The kitchen didn't understand your order.

- **Fix:** You likely sent bad data. Check your **Body** tab. Ensure you selected **raw** -> **JSON** and that your JSON syntax is perfect (all keys must be in "double quotes").
