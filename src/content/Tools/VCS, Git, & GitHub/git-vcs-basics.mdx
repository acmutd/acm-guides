Welcome! In this guide, we will set up **Git**, the industry-standard tool for tracking code changes and collaborating with other developers.

**What you'll learn:**

- **The Concept:** Understanding <Tooltip tip="Software that tracks changes to files over time, letting you revert, compare, and collaborate">**VCS**</Tooltip> as "save points."
- **The Setup:** How to install and configure Git on Windows and macOS.
- **The Commands:** The essential cheat sheet for your daily workflow.

## 🧠 1. What is Version Control?

Think of **Git** as a time machine for your code. It allows you to:

1.  **Track History:** See exactly who changed what line of code and when.
2.  **Collaborate:** Merge work from multiple people into one project without overwriting files.
3.  **Revert:** Broke the app? Jump back to a previous "save point" (<Tooltip tip="A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time, saved with a message describing the change">**commit**</Tooltip>) instantly.

### The Workflow

Visualizing where your code lives is half the battle.

| Stage                 | Description                                                       |
| :-------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Working Directory** | The files you are currently editing in VS Code.                   |
| **Staging Area**      | The "on-deck" circle. Files you are _about_ to save.              |
| **Local Repository**  | Your private history of saved snapshots (commits) on your laptop. |
| **Remote Repository** | The cloud version (GitHub/GitLab) where the team shares code.     |

## 💿 2. Installation

Before we start, verify if you already have Git installed.

**Verification Command:**

```bash
git --version
```

_If you see a version number (e.g., `git version 2.40.0`), you are good to go! If not, follow the steps below._

### 🪟 Windows

1. **Download:** Go to [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
2. **Run Installer:** Download the "Standalone Installer" (64-bit).
3. **The Setup Wizard:**

- Keep hitting "Next" through the defaults.
- _Critical:_ When asked about the default editor, select **Visual Studio Code**.
- _Critical:_ Ensure "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" is selected.

### 🍎 macOS

You have two easy options.

**Option A: Xcode Command Line Tools (Easiest)**
Open your terminal and type:

```bash
git --version
```

If not installed, macOS will prompt you to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Click "Install."

**Option B: <Tooltip tip="A package manager for macOS that lets you install developer tools from the command line">Homebrew</Tooltip> (Preferred)**
If you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed:

```bash
brew install git
```

## ⚙️ 3. First-Time Configuration

Once installed, you must introduce yourself to Git. This information will appear next to every change you make.

Open your terminal and run these two commands:

```bash
# 1. Set your username (Use your GitHub username or real name)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# 2. Set your email (Must match your GitHub email!)
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

**Verify your config:**

```bash
git config --list
```

## ⚡ 4. Essential Commands

These are the commands you will use 99% of the time.

### Starting Out

| Action    | Command           | Description                                           |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clone** | `git clone <URL>` | Download an existing repo from GitHub to your laptop. |
| **Init**  | `git init`        | Turn your current folder into a brand new Git repo.   |

### The "Save" Cycle

Every time you finish a task, follow this 3-step rhythm:

**1. Add (Stage)**
Move changes to the <Tooltip tip="A preparation area where you collect file changes before saving them as a commit">staging area</Tooltip>.

```bash
git add .
```

_(The `.` means "add all changed files". You can also specify a filename)._

**2. Commit (Save)**
Take a snapshot of the staged files.

```bash
git commit -m "Fixed the login bug"
```

_(Always write a clear message describing what you changed)._

**3. Push (Upload)**
Send your commits to the cloud (GitHub).

```bash
git push
```

### Checking In

**Status (The MVP)**
Run this constantly. It tells you what files are changed, staged, or <Tooltip tip="A file Git can see but isn't tracking yet and won't be included in commits until you `git add` it">untracked</Tooltip>.

```bash
git status
```

**Log**
See the history of commits (the timeline).

```bash
git log --oneline
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "fatal: not a git repository"

You are trying to run a git command inside a folder that isn't tracked.

- **Fix:** `cd` into the correct folder where you ran `git init` or `git clone`.

### "Permission denied (publickey)"

GitHub doesn't recognize your computer.

- **Fix:** You likely need to set up an <Tooltip tip="A pair of cryptographic keys used to securely authenticate with GitHub without a password">SSH key</Tooltip> or use a <Tooltip tip="A token you generate in GitHub settings to use as a password when authenticating over HTTPS">Personal Access Token</Tooltip>. For beginners, try cloning using the **HTTPS** URL instead of the **SSH** URL.

### "Merge conflict"

Two people changed the same line of code. Git doesn't know whose version to keep.

- **Fix:** Open the file in VS Code. You will see highlighted sections showing "Current Change" vs "Incoming Change". Choose one, save the file, then `git add .` and `git commit` again.
