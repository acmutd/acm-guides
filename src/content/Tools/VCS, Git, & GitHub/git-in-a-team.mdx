Welcome! In this guide, we will cover the practical workflow for using Git collaboratively: branch naming, creating clean <Tooltip tip="A request to merge your branch into another branch, typically reviewed by teammates before approval">Pull Requests (PRs)</Tooltip>, code review etiquette, and what to do when Git inevitably yells at you.

**What you'll learn:**

- **The Proper Route:** How to create branches with the right prefixes.
- **The PR Flow:** How to open, review, and merge Pull Requests.
- **The Fix:** How to handle merge conflicts without panicking.

## 🔀 1. Branches: The Proper Route

Before you start coding, you need an isolated place to work so you don't break the main project.

### Step 1: Start from `main`

Always make sure your local `main` branch is up to date before branching off.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
```

_(If your team uses `develop` instead of `main`, just swap the names!)_

### Step 2: Branch Naming

Use one of these prefixes followed by a short, <Tooltip tip="A naming style where words are separated by hyphens, i.e. `my-branch-name`">kebab-case</Tooltip> description of your work:

- `feat/` - New user-facing functionality or a meaningful addition.
- `fix/` - A bug fix or patching a <Tooltip tip="A bug that was accidentally introduced by a recent change that previously worked fine">regression</Tooltip>.
- `task/` - Chores, <Tooltip tip="Restructuring existing code to improve readability or structure without changing its behavior">refactors</Tooltip>, docs, or <Tooltip tip="Automated pipelines that run tests and checks whenever code is pushed">CI</Tooltip> tweaks that aren't user-facing.

**Examples:**
- `feat/auth-password-reset`
- `fix/navbar-overflow-mobile`
- `task/update-readme`

Create and switch to your new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/auth-password-reset
```

## 💾 2. Commit Hygiene

Make it easy for your team to understand your changes.

- **Keep commits small:** Aim for "one idea per commit."
- **Avoid "WIP" commits:** Unless you plan to <Tooltip tip="Squashing combines multiple commits into a single, cleaner commit before merging">squash</Tooltip> them later.
- **Write clear messages:**
  - `feat: add workshop card grid`
  - `fix: handle null updated date`
  - `task: format with prettier`

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add branch naming docs"
```

---

## 🚀 3. Pull Requests (PRs)

Once you have commits, push them to GitHub and open a Pull Request.

```bash
git push -u origin feat/auth-password-reset
```

### Push early, push often
Open a PR as soon as it's runnable, even if it's not perfect. A **Draft PR** is a great way to get early feedback and unblock others who might depend on your work.

### What makes a "Good PR"?
- **What changed:** 1–3 sentences explaining the addition.
- **Why it changed:** Context for the reviewer.
- **How to test it:** Steps or a short checklist.
- **Visuals:** Screenshots or GIFs for UI changes.

---

## 👀 4. Code Reviews

Code reviews are about collaboration, not criticism.

### How to respond like a pro
- **If you agree:** Implement the change and reply "Done."
- **If you disagree:** Explain your reasoning respectfully and offer an alternative.
- **If you don't understand:** Ask a direct question (e.g., "Could you clarify what you mean by X?").

### Keep the thread clean
When you push a fix based on feedback, reply to the specific comment or mark it as resolved so the reviewer knows to check it again.

---

## ⚡ 5. Staying Up-to-Date

If your PR is open for a while, your branch will drift from `main` as other people merge their code.

### Option A: Merge (Simpler, noisier history)
Pull the latest `main` code directly into your feature branch.

```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
git push
```

### Option B: Rebase (Clean, linear history)
<Tooltip tip="Rebase moves your commits to start from the tip of another branch, as if you'd branched off it just now, giving you a cleaner history">Replay your changes on top of the latest `main`.</Tooltip>

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
```
(Note: If you already pushed your branch, rebasing requires a <Tooltip tip="A force push overwrites the remote branch with your local version.">force push</Tooltip>: `git push --force-with-lease`)

Ask your team lead which approach the project prefers!

---

## 💥 6. Merge Conflicts

Conflicts happen when Git can't automatically combine your changes with someone else's. The goal is to make the final code correct, not just to "make Git happy."

### How to resolve them:
1. Open the conflicted file(s) in VS Code.
2. Look for the conflict markers:

```text
<<<<<<< HEAD
your changes
=======
their changes
>>>>>>> origin/main
```

3. Decide what the final code should be (VS Code usually provides "Accept Current", "Accept Incoming", or "Accept Both" buttons).
4. Save the file.
5. Mark it as resolved and continue:

```bash
git add path/to/file
git commit
```

**Abort if needed:** If you get overwhelmed and want to bail out, you can always run `git merge --abort` or `git rebase --abort`.

## ✅ Quick Checklist

Before you hit that big green Merge button:

- [ ] Branch name starts with `feat/`, `fix/`, or `task/`.
- [ ] PR explains what/why/how-to-test.
- [ ] Review feedback handled respectfully.
- [ ] Branch is up-to-date with `main` and conflicts are resolved.
- [ ] Your code actually runs locally!
