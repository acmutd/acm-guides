# acm guides
ACM’s documentation hub for workshop guides, tutorials, and practical resources - **built by students, for students**.

## What you’ll find here
- Workshop guides that help you go from “I’ve heard of this” to “I can build it.” 
- Quick, skimmable pages with clean navigation and an “On this page” table of contents. 
- A modern UI with ACM Dev's signature purple gradient. 

## How to use it
- Hit **Start Learning** on the homepage, or jump straight into **All Docs**. 
- Use the left sidebar to browse by topic (Workshops, Tools, etc.). 
- If something’s unclear, open an issue or PR. 

## Contributing (lightweight)
We love contributions - fix typos, clarify steps, add examples, or write a new guide. 

A good guide:
- Starts with what you’ll learn and what you need beforehand.
- Uses clear section headings (so the page TOC stays helpful). 
- Stays practical: commands, screenshots, short explanations, and “common mistakes.”

## Links
- Home / All Docs / GitHub are in the site navbar.
